here's a bunch of things you can say if you want or not
set the variable to 0 if you don't want it
and to 1 if you do
if they have (number) at the end it means you have to enter a value
global.noCoins = 
global.noChampions = 
global.fastStart = 
global.noShovel = 
global.noChargers = 
global.onePerWave = 	
global.disposableCards = 
global.fallingresource = "(number, more like word)"
(i'm not sure what those last two do, but they are in civil war)
global.noHearts = 
global.noProps = 
global.noSpecialPoop = 
global.noSpots = 
global.gSpeedSmooth = (number, 1 is the normal value)
global.gSpeed = (number, 1 is the normal value)
